# Auto-Save and Restore Feature Notes

## Overview
This feature adds the ability to auto-save the current tmux session state when started with pane, allowing users to restore sessions if tmux crashes or the system reboots unexpectedly.

## Requirements
- Automatically save session state periodically
- Allow manual restoration of saved sessions
- Never modify or overwrite configs in ~/.config/pane/
- Work similar to Microsoft Office auto-save functionality
- Provide a simple way to restore after a crash or forced reboot

## Implementation Considerations

### Storage Location
- Need a dedicated directory for saved sessions
- Potential location: ~/.local/share/pane/sessions/
- Each saved session will have a timestamp-based identifier

### Session State to Capture
- Window layout and counts
- Pane structure in each window
- Working directories for each pane
- Running commands (if possible)
- Session name

### Auto-Save Mechanism
- Periodic saving (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- Use a background process that doesn't interfere with the main session
- Possibly use tmux hooks to trigger saves

### Restoration Process
- Command-line option to restore the latest auto-saved session
- Option to list available auto-saved sessions
- Ability to restore a specific saved session by ID

### Implementation Approach
1. Add a session state capture mechanism
2. Implement auto-save functionality
3. Add restore commands and options
4. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Technical Challenges
- Capturing complex tmux session state
- Handling command restoration (may not be possible for all commands)
- Ensuring the auto-save process doesn't impact performance
- Managing storage space for saved sessions

## Questions to Consider
- How long should auto-saved sessions be kept?
- Should there be a confirmation before restoring?
- Should users be able to configure auto-save intervals?
