# Node.js Port Feature Notes

## Overview
This feature ports the Elixir implementation of Pane to JavaScript/Node.js for improved portability.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components Ported
- Main CLI interface
- Configuration loading and parsing
- Layout templates (Single, SplitVertical, TopSplitBottom)
- Tmux command generation
- Interactive terminal detection
- Preview mode

### Testing
- Basic test for CLI functionality implemented
- Manual testing should be performed for layout generation

### Improvements Over Original
- More portable through Node.js runtime
- Better file path handling with Node.js path module
- Direct integration with npm ecosystem for dependencies

### Limitations
- JavaScript implementation may be slightly slower than Elixir for some operations
- Requires Node.js runtime vs Elixir's compiled escript

## Setup and Installation
The installation script creates:
1. Installation directory at /usr/local/pane
2. Binary symlink at /usr/local/bin/pane
3. Configuration directory at ~/.config/pane
4. Default configuration if one doesn't exist

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider adding more templates
- Implement feature parity updates in both versions
- Look into using TypeScript for better type safety
