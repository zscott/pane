# Quad Layout Feature Notes

## Overview
This feature adds a new layout template called "Quad" that creates four equal-sized panes in a window. This layout would be useful for running multiple terminal processes simultaneously in equal-sized panes.

## Requirement Analysis
Based on the existing templates, we need to:

1. Create a new template module in both Elixir and Node.js implementations
2. Make the template follow the existing architecture and naming conventions
3. Add tests for the new template
4. Ensure it works with the existing layout application system

## Implementation Details

### Structure
The Quad layout will create four equal panes arranged in a 2x2 grid:
```
+-----------+-----------+
|           |           |
|   topLeft |  topRight |
|           |           |
+-----------+-----------+
|           |           |
| bottomLeft| bottomRight|
|           |           |
+-----------+-----------+
```

### Pane Names
- `:topLeft` (Elixir) / `'topLeft'` (Node.js)
- `:topRight` (Elixir) / `'topRight'` (Node.js) 
- `:bottomLeft` (Elixir) / `'bottomLeft'` (Node.js)
- `:bottomRight` (Elixir) / `'bottomRight'` (Node.js)

### Testing Approach
Following TDD principles, we'll create tests first for both implementations, then create the implementation to make the tests pass.
